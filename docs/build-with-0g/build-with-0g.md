# Building with 0G
---
0G provides robust tools and SDKs to seamlessly integrate decentralized storage and data availability into your applications. Whether you're building decentralized applications (dApps), working on blockchain projects, or seeking efficient data storage solutions, 0G has you covered.


## Data Availability Client Integration


A DA Client allows you to submit data to the 0G DA system and retrieve it later.

#### Key Components of DA Integration

1. **DA Client**: Allows you to submit data to the 0G DA system and retrieve it later.
2. **Encoder**: Processes and encodes data for efficient storage and retrieval.
3. **Retriever**: Retrieves data from the 0G DA system.

#### Integrating with the DA Node

To interact with the DA node, you can:

1. Use the gRPC API to submit and retrieve data
2. Leverage the provided SDKs for easier integration
3. Interact directly with the DA contracts on the 0G chain

## Storage Integration

On the next page, you'll find a detailed guide for integrating with 0G storage using the [Storage CLI](build-with-0g/sdk.md) and SDKs. These tools allow you to easily store, retrieve, and manage data on the 0G network.
