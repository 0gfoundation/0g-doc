# Babylon AVS on 0G DA

## Component Independence

0G DA is a fully independent component of the 0G ecosystem. When building Babylon AVS with 0G DA, you can:

- Use 0G DA as a standalone data availability layer without other 0G components
- Integrate Babylon staking systems with 0G DA for secure data availability
- Leverage 0G DA's security and cost-effectiveness independently
- Create Bitcoin staking solutions without dependencies on other 0G components
