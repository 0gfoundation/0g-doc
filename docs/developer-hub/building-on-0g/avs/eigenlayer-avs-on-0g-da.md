# EigenLayer AVS on 0G DA

## Component Independence

0G DA is a fully independent component of the 0G ecosystem. When building EigenLayer AVS with 0G DA, you can:

- Use 0G DA as a standalone data availability layer without other 0G components
- Integrate EigenLayer AVS systems with 0G DA for secure data availability
- Leverage 0G DA's security and cost-effectiveness independently
- Build active validator systems without dependencies on other 0G components
