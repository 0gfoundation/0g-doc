# Overview

The **AI Alignment Node** is a blockchain-based node that contributes to the 0G Compute network validation operations. Each node requires a **License NFT**, which entitles the holder (Node Owner) to run a node or delegate node-running privileges to a **Node Operator**.

## Node Owner vs. Node Operator

In the 0G ecosystem, there are two distinct but complementary roles:

1. **Node Owner**
    - **Holds License NFTs** (one or multiple).
    - Manages licenses (delegate, undelegate, claim rewards) via a dedicated web portal or CLI.
    - Earns the majority share of the node's rewards, minus any operator's commission.
2. **Node Operator**
    - **Runs and maintains the nodes** on behalf of Node Owners.
    - Either owns a license personally or is whitelisted by 0G (as a NAAS provider).
    - Registers as an operator using the CLI and specifies a commission rate.
    - Has CLI commands to accept delegations (`approve`) and forcibly undelegate if needed.

**Key Points:**

- License NFTs can be purchased or acquired; ownership grants the right to run a node or delegate it.
- Delegation allows a Node Owner to let Node operater to operate the node on their behalf.
- Rewards (in the form of tokens) are generated by running a node. these rewards are primarily directed to the Node Owner, minus an operator commission (if delegated on commission basis).
