# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the 0G documentation. Use this as a reference to understand technical concepts and terminology.

## A

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)
Systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve based on the information they collect.

### AVS (Actively Validated Service)
A decentralized service that uses validators to ensure correctness and security, often built on frameworks like EigenLayer.

## B

### Blockchain
A distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively.

### Blob
Binary Large Object, a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system.

## C

### Consensus
The process by which a network of nodes reaches agreement on the state of a distributed ledger or blockchain.

### Chain
The blockchain component of 0G that handles transactions and smart contracts.

### Compute Network
0G's decentralized framework for AI inference and fine-tuning.

## D

### DA (Data Availability)
A system ensuring that data related to blockchain transactions is available for verification by network participants.

### deAIOS (decentralized AI Operating System)
0G's complete stack of infrastructure components designed specifically for decentralized AI applications.

### Disperse Servers
Components in 0G Storage that handle erasure coding and data distribution across storage nodes.

## E

### Erasure Coding
A method of data protection where data is broken into fragments, expanded, and encoded with redundant pieces for reliability.

### ERC-7857
The token standard for Intelligent NFTs (INFTs) that enables secure tokenization of AI agents.

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
A computation engine that handles smart contract deployment and execution in Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

## I

### INFT (Intelligent NFT)
A token standard (ERC-7857) designed for AI agents that enables secure metadata transfer and privacy-preserving capabilities.

### Inference
The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate outputs based on input data.

## K

### KV Layer (Key-Value Layer)
A component of 0G Storage built on top of the Log Layer, optimized for structured, mutable data.

## L

### Layer 1 (L1)
The base blockchain architecture providing the fundamental security and consensus mechanisms.

### Layer 2 (L2)
A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency.

### Log Layer
Component of 0G Storage that handles unstructured data in an append-only system.

## M

### Merkle Root
A cryptographic hash representing a large set of data, used to verify data integrity.

### Modular Blockchain
A blockchain design where components (consensus, execution, settlement, etc.) can be optimized independently.

## N

### Node
A computer or server that participates in a blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the ledger or providing specific services.

## O

### Oracle
An entity that connects blockchains to external systems, enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world inputs and outputs.

### OP Stack
The open-source software stack developed by Optimism for running optimistic rollups.

## P

### PoRA (Proof of Random Access)
0G Storage's consensus mechanism where miners are challenged to prove they are storing specific data chunks.

### Precompile
Built-in smart contracts that are part of the protocol implementation, optimized for specific functions.

## Q

### Quorum
The minimum number of nodes required to agree for a transaction to be considered valid or for the network to reach consensus.

## R

### Rollup
Layer 2 scaling solution that performs transaction execution outside the main blockchain but posts transaction data on the main chain.

### RaaS (Rollup-as-a-Service)
Platforms that enable developers to deploy and manage rollup solutions without handling the underlying infrastructure.

## S

### Shared Staking
0G's mechanism where validators stake on Ethereum mainnet to secure multiple 0G consensus networks simultaneously.

### Storage Node
A node in the 0G network that stores and serves data.

## T

### TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
A secure area of a processor that guarantees code and data loaded inside is protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.

## V

### Validator
A node that participates in the consensus mechanism of a blockchain, verifying transactions and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

### VRF (Verifiable Random Function)
A cryptographic function that generates random values in a way that is both unpredictable and verifiable by others.

## Z

### ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof)
A cryptographic method allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

### Zero Gravity (0G)
The name of the platform, representing the goal of achieving a state of weightlessness in digital interactions where users and developers don't feel the constraints of infrastructure.
