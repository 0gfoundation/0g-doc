# Purchasing Nodes: Steps and Payment Options
**Supported Blockchains and Payment Methods**: The sale will be conducted in wETH on ARB, but we provide a live bridging gateway at checkout that supports multiple blockchains (ETH, Arbitrum, BNB), with accepted tokens including ETH and USDC. All purchases require a compatible wallet, and the resulting node licenses are issued as non-transferable ERC-721 NFTs.

## Step-by-Step Purchase Process:
### Step 1 - Go to https://node.0gfoundation.ai and connect your wallet
### Step 2 - Select the chain and token you want to purchase in 
### Step 3 - View the tiers available and purchase
In total there are [32] available for purchase. If you hold a whitelisted address, the Tier that you are entitled to will be shown on the top. Sold out tiers will be moved to the bottom of the page.
### Step 4 - Set the quantity
Start by inputting the number of node(s) that you will be purchasing.
### Step 5 - Input Promo Code (Optional)
If you have a Promo Code, input before your purchase. The discount rate will be applied directly to your checkout price.
Additionally, if you have already purchased a node, you can provide your wallet address as a referral promo code too! This will provide a 10% rebate to the referral, and 10% commission if they purchase successfully. 
### Step 6 - Approve transaction
Once you are confirmed on the final price, click the "Approve" button. You are then required to approve the transaction via your wallet.
### Step 7 - Complete purchase
Continue by clicking "Purchase". You will need to confirm the transaction via your wallet.
