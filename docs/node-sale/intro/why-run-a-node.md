# Why Run a Node?

Running a node on the 0G network offers participants a chance to directly contribute to the growth and security of our decentralized AI ecosystem. Nodes are the backbone of our network, enabling the following:
- **Decentralization**: Ensure the network remains decentralized and resilient.
- **Network Security**: Enhance the security and reliability of the network by verifying transactions.
- **AI Processing Power**: Support AI computations, thereby contributing to the network's ability to deliver on-chain AI services.
- **Reward Opportunities**: Node operators can earn rewards in the form of native tokens or other incentives for their contribution to the network.
