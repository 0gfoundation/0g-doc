# What is an AI Alignment Node?

Alignment nodes provide the key utility of monitoring whether the other kinds of decentralized nodes in the 0G network - validator nodes, storage nodes, security nodes - faithfully follow network protocols. To start, the nodes will have certain utility, and in the near future, AI Alignment Nodes will have additional utility to monitor on-chain AI model drift and to ensure that 0Gâ€™s on-chain AI is behaving as intended.

To sustain the node utility operation and allow the network to be further secured, Alignment Node owners may receive a portion of the fees collected by the network by operating the nodes and contributing work to the 0G network. Node sale participants and stakers (i.e., long term believers who secure the ecosystem) may get additional rewards from the 0G ecosystem over time. 0G node sale will be a launch that enables the community to participate on an equal playing field with entry points within multiple tiers.
