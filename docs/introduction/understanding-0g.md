# Understanding 0G

import LottieAnimation from '@site/src/components/lottieAnimation';

## Why 0G Exists

Imagine trying to run ChatGPT on a blockchain today. It would be:
- **Impossibly expensive** - Millions in gas fees just to store a model
- **Extremely slow** - Minutes or hours for a single AI response
- **Technically unfeasible** - Current blockchains can't handle AI's massive data needs

**That's the problem 0G solves.**

## What is 0G?

0G (Zero Gravity) is the first decentralized AI L1 chain that orchestrates hardware resources (storage, compute) and software assets (data, models) to handle AI workloads at scale. It bridges the gap between Web2 AI capabilities and Web3 decentralization.

:::info 0G makes AI applications possible on blockchain - affordably and at scale.
:::

**How it works**: 0G provides four independent services that solve different pieces of the AI + blockchain puzzle:
- **Storage** ‚Üí Where to keep massive AI datasets
- **Compute** ‚Üí How to run AI models economically  
- **Chain** ‚Üí Where to execute AI transactions quickly
- **Data Availability** ‚Üí How to ensure data is always accessible

## üéØ Modular Architecture

:::tip Key Benefit of Modular Architecture: You DON'T need to use all of 0G!
**Pick only what you need:**
- Just need storage? ‚úÖ Use only 0G Storage  
- Want AI compute? ‚úÖ Use only 0G Compute
- Happy with Ethereum? ‚úÖ Stay there and use our services
- Building fresh? ‚úÖ Use everything for maximum performance
:::


### Integration Flexibility
- **Already on Ethereum, Polygon, or any EVM chain?** Use 0G Storage and Compute directly from your existing smart contracts
- **Building on Solana or other non-EVM chains?** Our SDKs support cross-chain integration
- **Need only storage?** Use 0G Storage without touching blockchain components
- **Want AI compute?** Access our Compute Network from any application


## The 4 Components of 0G

### ‚õìÔ∏è 0G Chain
The fastest, most modular blockchain, making on-chain gaming and AI a reality. 
- *Optional - not required to use other services*
- *EVM-compatible for easy integration*

### üíæ 0G Storage Network
A decentralized storage network optimized for massive data loads. 
- *Works with any blockchain or standalone*
- *10-100x cheaper than alternatives*

### ü§ñ 0G Compute Network
A versatile framework for AI compute, including fast data retrieval, model inference/training, etc. 
- *Accessible from any platform*
- *Pay only for what you use*

### üìä 0G DA (Data Availability)
An infinitely scalable and programmable data availability layer designed for high-performance chains. 
- *Can be integrated with any rollup or chain*
- *Ensures data is always accessible*

## Key Concepts Explained Simply

<details>
<summary>**What is decentralized storage? üóÑÔ∏è**</summary>

Instead of storing your files on one company's computer (like Google Drive), they're split and stored across hundreds of computers worldwide.

**Why it matters**: If Google's servers crash, you lose access. With decentralized storage, even if 50 computers fail, your data is still safe and accessible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is data availability?** üì°</summary>

It's a guarantee that your data can always be accessed when needed, like having multiple backup generators for your house.

**Why it matters**: In blockchain, if data isn't available, the whole system can freeze. 0G ensures this never happens.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is an AI compute network?** üß†</summary>

It's like Uber for computing power - connect to available GPUs when you need to run AI models, pay only for what you use.

**Why it matters**: Instead of buying expensive GPUs or relying on big tech companies, access computing power on-demand from a global network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is a modular blockchain?** üß©</summary>

Like LEGO blocks, each part of the blockchain (storing data, processing transactions, reaching agreement) is separate and can be upgraded independently.

**Why it matters**: Traditional blockchains are like old phones where you can't upgrade just the camera. Modular blockchains let you improve each part without rebuilding everything.
</details>

## Why "Zero Gravity"?

"0G" represents "Zero Gravity" - the state where everything flows effortlessly. Just as astronauts move freely in zero gravity, data and AI computations flow seamlessly through our network without the heavy "gravity" of:
- High costs
- Slow speeds  
- Technical barriers
- Platform lock-in

## What Can You Build?

With 0G's technology, previously impossible use cases are now within reach:

- **On-chain AI agents** that learn and evolve
- **Decentralized ChatGPT** alternatives
- **AI-powered DeFi** trading systems
- **Medical AI** with patient-owned data
- **Large-scale ML training** without AWS bills

And this is just the beginning.
