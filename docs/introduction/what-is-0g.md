# What is 0G

## The First Decentralized AI Operating System (deAIOS)

**0G (Zero Gravity)** is the first decentralized AI [operating system](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) that acts as the foundational layer for decentralized AI applications and chains. It efficiently orchestrates utilization of hardware resources such as storage and compute and software assets such as data and models to handle the scale and complexity of AI workloads.

Specifically designed for AI (d)applications and chains, 0G features the fastest, infinitely scalable data availability (DA) layer, the cheapest decentralized storage system, and a novel flexible serving framework for inferences and fine-tuning. Prior to 0G, resource-intensive AI applications would only be feasible "off-chain" due to burdensome on-chain costs, low latency and throughput, and a lack of builder-friendly tooling.

For the first time ever, 0G bridges this cost and efficiency gap between Web2 and Web3, empowering builders to confidently deploy AI applications on-chain with _improved_ performance.

## Modular Architecture

0G is designed with a modular architecture where each component can be used independently:

- **0G Chain**: The fastest, most modular blockchain, making on-chain gaming and AI a reality.
- **0G Storage Network**: A decentralized storage network optimized for massive data loads.
- **0G Compute Network**: A versatile framework for AI compute, including fast data retrieval, model inference/training, etc.
- **0G DA**: An infinitely scalable and programmable data availability layer designed for high-performance chains.

**Important**: Each component of 0G can be used independently. Developers can choose to use only 0G Storage, only 0G Compute, only 0G Chain, or any combination based on their specific needs. There is no requirement to use the full stack.

All of these network components utilize carefully designed and innovative sharding mechanisms to achieve infinite horizontal scalability, thereby removing obstacles to the true democratization of AI.

## 0G's Namesake

"0G" gets its name from "Zero Gravity," personifying the ultimate goal of achieving a state of weightlessness where transactions and data exchanges can occur effortlessly. Infrastructure should be customizable for developers and invisible to the end-user.

With 0G's technology, the possibilities are endless. Previously infeasible use cases are now within reach, including:

- On-chain AI, including training large language models (LLMs)
- Storage of entire AI agent networks on-chain
- Storage of large datasets for data cleaning and labeling

And this is just the beginning.
