# 0G Ecosystem

The 0G ecosystem is a comprehensive network of technologies, partners, and community members working together to democratize AI. This page provides an overview of the key components and participants in our ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Components

### Infrastructure Layer
- **0G Chain**: The foundational blockchain for transactions and smart contracts
- **0G Storage**: Decentralized storage for AI datasets and models
- **0G Compute**: Distributed computing resources for AI workloads
- **0G DA**: Data availability layer for scalable applications

### Developer Tools
- **SDKs**: Software development kits for multiple programming languages
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for node operation and development
- **APIs**: RESTful and gRPC APIs for seamless integration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and tutorials

### Applications & Use Cases
- **On-chain AI Models**: Deploy and run AI models directly on-chain
- **Decentralized Training**: Train models using distributed compute resources
- **AI Agent Networks**: Build and deploy networks of AI agents
- **Data Markets**: Trade and monetize AI datasets

## Ecosystem Participants

### Developers
Build decentralized AI applications using 0G's infrastructure and tools.

### Node Operators
Run validator, storage, or compute nodes to support the network and earn rewards.

### Data Providers
Contribute datasets to the network and monetize valuable data.

### AI Researchers
